# Hate Crimes Map

![Hate Crimes Map](public/screen.png)

## Project Goal

The **Hate Crimes Map** project aims to visualize hate crime data to bring visibility to crimes that are often invisible or normalized by society. By making this data accessible and visual, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of these issues.

## Data Source

The data displayed in this project is sourced from the official OSCE Hate Crime Reporting database, which can be accessed here: [https://hatecrime.osce.org/hate-crime-data](https://hatecrime.osce.org/hate-crime-data).

If you notice that the data is outdated, we invite you to contribute! Convert the `.xlsx` file from the source into a `.json` file and upload it to the following path in the repository: `/public/data/hcrw_incidents_all-report.json`. Donâ€™t forget to create a pull request after updating the file.

## Caution

Please note that this data should be interpreted with caution. The data only includes participating OSCE member states and the number and nature of reported hate crimes can vary significantly between countries due to:

- Limited geographical coverage (OSCE participating states only)
- Varying levels of freedom of expression
- Different reporting mechanisms and practices
- Cultural and social factors affecting reporting

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with the OSCE or any other organization.
